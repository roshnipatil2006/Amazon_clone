# Amazon_clone

✨ This is a front-end clone of the Amazon website, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **Font Awesome**.💻🚀 The project aims to replicate the look and feel of Amazon’s home page, including its navigation bar, language options, product categories, carousel slider, and promotional cards. It's a great example of how to structure a real-world e-commerce homepage with responsive design principles.
